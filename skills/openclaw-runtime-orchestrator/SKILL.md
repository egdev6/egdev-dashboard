## Activation Contract

Use this skill as the OpenClaw-facing entry point for Discord-originated runtime requests before invoking product workflow skills.

This skill does not execute writes, publish content, schedule content, mutate GitHub, or run Gentle SDD directly. It classifies the turn, selects the runner boundary, and returns reviewable execution metadata.

## Runtime Pipeline

Follow the contract in `docs/architecture/discord-runtime-orchestrator.md`:

```text
Discord event envelope
-> origin resolution
-> managed channel route
-> channel guide ref
-> context pack ref
-> skill pack ref
-> intent classification
-> runner selection
-> permission/confirmation gate
-> execution metadata
-> writeback policy
```

## Runner Boundaries

| Intent family | Runner/backend | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `planning_content` | `openclaw-skill-surface` | Use scoped workflow skills selected by `scoped-skill-resolver`. |
| `sdd_dev_work` | `gentle-sdd` | Handoff to Gentle SDD protocol assets only; do not treat product workflow skills as SDD executors. |
| `clarification_needed` | `response-only` | Ask for route or intent clarification; do not hydrate durable context. |

## Hard Rules

- Resolve scope and effective skills before using any workflow skill.
- Always include `discord-approval-gate` for write-like flows.
- Do not expose raw Discord IDs, secrets, transcripts, screenshots, or private payloads in repo artifacts.
- Do not claim live Discord, production, publishing, scheduling, Buffer, or durable write success from no-op/model-mediated checks.
- Treat Gentle-AI SDD assets as preserved protocol/backend assets under `.openclaw/skills`, not legacy product skills.

## Output Contract

Return a compact metadata block:

```text
intent_family: <planning_content|sdd_dev_work|clarification_needed>
selected_backend_or_runner: <openclaw-skill-surface|gentle-sdd|response-only>
skill_pack_ref: <resolved-pack-or-none>
effective_skills: [<skill-name>]
mandatory_skills: [discord-approval-gate] # for write-like flows
approval_required: <true|false>
writes_attempted: false
boundary_notes: <one sentence>
```

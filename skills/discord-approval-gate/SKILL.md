## Activation Contract

Use this skill for any Discord-originated request that includes `save`, `write`, `update`, `remember`, `store`, `queue`, `ledger`, `publish`, or `schedule` intent, or otherwise may persist state.

Also use it when a route-resolved skill proposes writes to project, network, strategy, brand, content-ledger, or runtime workspace state.

## Hard Rules

- Treat `save`, `write`, `update`, `remember`, `store`, `queue`, `ledger`, `publish`, and `schedule` as write-like until proven safe.
- Before explicit approval, do not call file, memory, ledger, queue, publishing, scheduling, or workspace persistence tools.
- The first response must be `proposal` or `approval-requested`; show the exact target namespace, runtime audit namespace, and change summary.
- Accept only the exact phrase `approve write` as approval. Treat silence, emoji, and unrelated replies as no approval.
- If the operator replies `revise: <instruction>`, produce a revised proposal and ask again.
- If the operator replies `reject`, stop without persistence and summarize what did not happen.
- After approval, write only the displayed target namespaces and keep publishing, scheduling, Buffer, and unrelated memory out of scope unless separately approved.
- Do not store secrets, raw private transcripts, real exports, or unredacted Discord IDs in durable project memory.

## Decision Gates

| Situation | Response |
| --- | --- |
| Matched route + write-like request | Ask for `approve write` before any persistence. |
| Unmapped route | Do not read or write durable project memory; ask for an approved route. |
| Read-only question | Answer from allowed context without proposing writes. |
| Approval phrase received | Persist only the previously displayed change and displayed namespaces. |
| Revision or rejection | No persistence; revise proposal or stop. |

## Execution Steps

1. Resolve runtime context as `discord-project-manager/runtime/discord/<guild-id>/<channel-id>` without exposing raw IDs in repo artifacts.
2. Resolve durable read candidates only when the route is matched.
3. Classify the request as read-only or write-like.
4. For write-like requests, return the approval prompt from `docs/operations/discord-approval-responses.md`.
5. Keep the pre-approval audit trail in the response unless the runtime provides explicitly non-durable channel-local scratch state.
6. After `approve write`, perform the approved write and record the final audit trail.

## Output Contract

For write-like requests, return:

```text
Proposed durable update
Route: <project>/<network>
Runtime context: discord-project-manager/runtime/discord/<guild-id>/<channel-id>
Target namespace: <namespace-key>
Runtime audit namespace: discord-project-manager/runtime/discord/<guild-id>/<channel-id>
Change summary: <one-sentence summary>
Risk boundary: <what this does not do>

Reply with exactly one option:
- approve write
- revise: <instruction>
- reject
```

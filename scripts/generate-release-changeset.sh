# ${VERSION} internal fake-first/local baseline

This release promotes the current release branch to main as an internal fake-first/local baseline.

It is intended for repository review, local Docker/runtime rehearsal, contract validation, and follow-up release hardening. It does **not** claim production readiness, public Discord readiness, live Discord execution, live social publishing/scheduling, live analytics ingestion, or durable production writes.

## Release scope

Status statement preserved for this baseline:

> Internal fake-first/local baseline complete. Private Docker and local disposable validations passed. QA-07 private Discord routing execution remains gated and was not executed. Production readiness is not claimed.

The release owner explicitly defers private Discord execution for this tag unless a separate approved issue completes it first. QA-07/private Discord execution remains gated until a separate approved issue executes and reviews docs/operations/private-discord-manual-verification-guide.md with sanitized evidence.

## Changeset

Generated from ${BASE_REF}..${HEAD_REF}.

Commits in range: ${commit_count}

| Ref | Summary |
| --- | --- |
${changes_table}
## Validation evidence

Run before opening or merging the release-promotion PR:

~~~bash
git diff --check
bash scripts/validate-release-promotion.sh --base origin/main --head HEAD
bash scripts/validate-repo-safe-evidence.sh
bash scripts/validate-openclaw-gentle-ai-runtime.sh
bash scripts/validate-openclaw-skill-inventory.sh
SAFE_VALIDATION_SKIP_STAGE0=1 bash scripts/run-safe-validation-suite.sh
~~~

PR checks on the release-promotion PR must also pass before merge to main.

## Known limitations

- QA-07/private Discord execution is gated unless a separate approved issue completes it first.
- No public Discord behavior is claimed.
- No production hosting, high availability, backup/restore, or operational SLO is claimed.
- No live social publishing, scheduling, Buffer activity, or live analytics ingestion is claimed.
- Local/no-op orchestration evidence must not be restated as deterministic production enforcement.
- Gentle SDD assets are packaged as OpenClaw workspace protocol/backend assets, not Pi subagents running inside OpenClaw.

## Rollback notes

This promotion is repository-only. If a release problem is found after merge, open a hotfix issue/PR against main, then back-merge or cherry-pick the fix into develop.

## Post-merge actions

After the release-promotion PR merges, the Release tag and notes workflow should create the matching ${VERSION} tag and GitHub Release from this file if they do not already exist.

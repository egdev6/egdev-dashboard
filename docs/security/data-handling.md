# Data handling rules

Use this runbook before onboarding any real Discord server, brand, Buffer account, or Engram memory.

## Quick path

1. Keep real secrets in `.env` or a host secret store, never in git.
2. Treat Docker volumes, Engram exports, and runtime logs as private by default.
3. Use fake/demo fixtures only in public docs, tests, and screenshots.
4. If data is exposed, stop sharing, rotate secrets, and document the incident privately first.

## Secret handling

| Secret or identifier | Public in repo? | Where it belongs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Rotate immediately if exposed. |
| Discord guild IDs | Usually no | `.env`, runtime config, or private notes | Treat real guild/channel mappings as private unless intentionally public. |
| Discord channel IDs | No | Runtime memory/config only | Do not publish screenshots or logs with private channel IDs unless sanitized. |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Required for token-auth Gateway access. |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Client bearer token for Engram Cloud. |
| `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Admin-only secret; never share with clients. |
| `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Must be strong and private. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Treat DB credentials as production secrets once real memory exists. |
| `BUFFER_ACCESS_TOKEN` / `BUFFER_API_KEY` | No | `.env` or secret manager | Grants Buffer API access; current public API should not be assumed to expose LinkedIn/X analytics metrics. |
| `BUFFER_ACCOUNT_ID` | Usually no | `.env` or private config | Keep private unless intentionally documented for a public demo. |
| `.env.example` placeholders | Yes | git | Names and fake `change-me-*` values only. |

## Public vs private storage

| Storage location | Default classification | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md`, `docs/`, `openspec/`, `skills/` | Public | Keep reusable docs, ADRs, contracts, and fake examples only. |
| `.env` | Private | Never commit. Real tokens and URLs only. |
| Docker volumes (`openclaw-home`, `engram-postgres`) | Private | Runtime state and real memory live here. |
| Engram memory | Private by default | Operational memory until promoted into a repo artifact. |
| Engram exports/backups | Private | Never commit raw exports or database dumps. |
| Logs, transcripts, screenshots | Private by default | Sanitize before sharing or attaching to issues/PRs. |

## Retention and export rules

- Treat all raw Engram exports, sync archives, SQL dumps, and volume snapshots as private.
- Never commit raw Engram exports, Postgres dumps, Discord transcripts, or Buffer response payloads.
- Promote only sanitized, durable knowledge into repo artifacts:
  - architecture decisions;
  - approved namespace conventions;
  - reusable skill behavior;
  - review-facing summaries;
  - public runbooks.
- Keep transient runtime memory in Engram unless it becomes durable project knowledge.
- Disposable smoke-test volumes may be deleted with `docker compose down -v` **only** when they do not contain real memory.
- If a volume contains real memory, require backup plus explicit human approval before reset or deletion.
- When exporting for backup, keep files outside the repo and name them as private operational assets.

## Fake fixture rules

Use fake/demo data for all public examples unless the content is intentionally public and approved.

Required rules:

- Use `example.invalid` or obviously fake URLs.
- Use fake IDs for guilds, channels, posts, and assets.
- Use fake analytics values or `unknown` when demonstrating metrics.
- Do not use real customer, employee, creator, or community member names.
- Do not include screenshots containing private Discord channels, DMs, brand plans, or analytics dashboards.
- Do not paste real Engram memory entries into docs or PRs.
- Clearly label examples as `fake`, `demo`, or `sanitized`.

## Incident guidance

If private data or secrets are exposed:

1. Stop sharing immediately.
   - Pause pushes, PR updates, screenshots, and exports.
2. Contain the leak.
   - Revoke public links if possible.
   - Remove exposed files from the working tree and future commits.
3. Rotate affected secrets.
   - Discord bot token
   - OpenClaw gateway token
   - Engram Cloud token/admin/JWT secret
   - Postgres password
   - Buffer token
4. Clean git history if the secret reached the repo.
   - Remove the secret from current files.
   - Rewrite history if required.
   - Force-push only with explicit maintainer approval.
5. Assess runtime data.
   - Decide whether Docker volumes, Engram exports, or logs also need purge/rotation.
6. Document privately.
   - Record what leaked, where, when, what was rotated, and remaining risk.
7. Promote sanitized lessons.
   - If the incident teaches a reusable rule, add that rule to repo docs without reproducing the secret or private data.

## PR author checklist

Before opening a PR, confirm:

- [ ] No `.env`, tokens, or real URLs with embedded secrets are included.
- [ ] No Docker volume exports, SQL dumps, or raw Engram exports are included.
- [ ] Examples use fake IDs, fake names, fake metrics, and safe URLs.
- [ ] Screenshots/logs are sanitized or omitted.
- [ ] Durable decisions were promoted to docs/ADRs instead of copied as raw memory.
- [ ] Any cleanup/reset command is clearly labeled as safe only for disposable smoke environments.

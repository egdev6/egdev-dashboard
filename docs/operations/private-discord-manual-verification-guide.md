# Private Discord manual verification guide

Use this guide to organize **manual** operator verification for the planned Discord workflow in a **private non-production environment**.

This is a repo-safe preparation and test-organization guide only. It does **not** prove production readiness, public Discord readiness, live routing safety, durable write safety, or approval enforcement. The current repository baseline remains **internal fake-first/local only**.

## Quick path

1. Confirm the private/local runtime baseline is already green.
2. Prepare a private Discord topology with fake/demo names and no public surfaces.
3. Review global governance and managed Project Manager scaffolding separately.
4. Run only no-op/manual checks until managed status/repair and approval boundaries are proven.
5. Capture sanitized evidence only and stop on any boundary breach.

## Safety boundary

| Topic | Rule |
|---|---|
| Repository baseline | Internal fake-first/local only |
| Live Discord execution | Gated; not proven by current repo evidence |
| Plugin behavior | Prerequisite only; not validated by this guide |
| Production/public usage | Out of scope |
| Durable writes | Never before explicit `approve write` and proven enforcement |
| Approval enforcement | Treat as a contract to verify, **not** as already safe runtime behavior |
| Evidence | Sanitized only; no real IDs, credentials, transcripts, or private payloads |

## Manual prerequisites and approvals

Complete these before any private Discord rehearsal:

| Requirement | Why it matters | Repo-safe rule |
|---|---|---|
| Private non-production guild | Prevents public/live spillover | Do not commit the real guild ID |
| Private non-production channels | Needed for managed Project Manager topology checks | Do not commit real channel IDs |
| Non-production credentials | Required for any future live-adjacent runtime hookup | Keep outside git and PR text |
| Private/local Docker runtime already validated | Discord checks must start from a known local runtime baseline | Reuse `docs/operations/runtime-pilot-checklist.md` and `docs/operations/qa-private-docker-runtime-smoke-walkthrough.md` |
| Explicit human approval | QA-07 remains gated | Record only the decision, not secrets |
| Proven no-op observation path | Managed status/repair and approval behavior must be verifiable without prompt execution or durable writes | Accept only status preview, repair preview, dry-run mode, or re-tested enforcement |

Manual user steps required before future execution: **yes**.

Required future manual prerequisites:

- provide a private non-production Discord guild;
- provide private non-production channels;
- provide non-production credentials outside the repo;
- explicitly approve the private Discord rehearsal;
- confirm a no-op resolver diagnostic, plugin/runtime dry-run mode, or re-tested enforcement path exists before any private message is sent.

## What is in scope vs out of scope

| Layer | In scope for this guide | Out of scope |
|---|---|---|
| Docs/planning | topology, naming, manual test organization, pass/fail expectations | claiming the Discord runtime already passed |
| Local/private runtime | startup, health, skill sync, safe shutdown | public hosting, production services |
| Private Discord-live-adjacent rehearsal | preparation, gating, manual checklists, sanitized evidence shape | unapproved plugin execution, prompt execution, durable writes, public Discord behavior |

## Start and stop the local environment

Use the runtime checklist as the source of truth. Start from a private/local shell only.

### Startup

```bash
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose --profile setup run --rm openclaw-setup
docker compose up -d postgres engram openclaw
docker compose ps
docker compose exec openclaw node -e "fetch('http://127.0.0.1:18789/healthz').then(async r => { console.log(r.status, await r.text()) })"
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
```

### Shutdown

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose ps
```

### Environment checklist

- [ ] `.env` is private and untracked.
- [ ] OpenClaw is healthy on loopback only.
- [ ] Engram is healthy on loopback only.
- [ ] Current tracked skills are present in the OpenClaw workspace.
- [ ] No `docker compose down -v` was used.
- [ ] No Discord plugin action is taken in this issue.

Use these docs together:

- `docs/operations/runtime-pilot-checklist.md`
- `docs/operations/private-docker-runtime-validation.md`
- `docs/operations/qa-private-docker-runtime-smoke-walkthrough.md`

## Discord topology to create manually

Use fake/demo names in docs and notes. Keep real guild/channel IDs outside the repo.

### A. Global governance/control category

`OpenClaw Global` is a reserved control category for governance, not a standard routed content channel set.

Use `docs/architecture/openclaw-global-channel-guides.md` and `examples/openclaw-global-channel-guides.fake.yaml` as the canonical repo-safe source for each control channel's topic and pin-ready starter guidance. Creating the category/channels is not enough: the private setup also needs the approved descriptive copy, previewed first and written only after `approve write`.

Suggested control channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Route-matched? | Guide copy source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `identity` | stable project identity and positioning | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |
| `writing-style` | voice and reusable style guidance | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |
| `operating-principles` | review, quality, and collaboration rules | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |
| `boundaries` | privacy, safety, and no-go constraints | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |
| `inheritance` | explicit opt-in inheritance review | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |
| `skills` | scoped skill review and override discussion | no | OpenClaw Global guide catalog |

These channels remain separate from Project Manager managed global channels such as `global-context` and `global-skills`.

### B. Project Manager managed scaffolding

The current Project Manager topology is no longer based on ad hoc review/control channels. Instead, it uses one managed global category plus one managed category per project.

#### Project Manager global category

Managed global channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Managed scope |
|---|---|---|
| `global-context` | workspace-wide context, conventions, and constraints | global |
| `global-skills` | reusable skills, defaults, and inheritance decisions | global |
| `global-strategy` | cross-project priorities and strategy | global |
| `global-decisions` | shared decisions and rationale | global |
| `global-config` | operator-visible workspace/runtime config | global |

#### Project category channels

Per-project managed channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Managed scope |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | project-local context, assumptions, and boundaries | project |
| `skills` | project-local skills and approved overrides | project |
| `strategy` | project roadmap, slices, and tradeoffs | project |
| `tasks` | actionable implementation work | project |
| `decisions` | project-local decisions and rationale | project |
| `qa` | validation plans, manual checks, and release gates | project |

These managed categories/channels are distinct from the reserved `OpenClaw Global` governance/control category. Managed channel routing should resolve scope, field, and project from persisted semantic metadata/IDs instead of display-name inference.

## How to create categories and channels

Use the Discord UI manually. Keep notes sanitized.

### Create a global/control category

1. Propose a private category named `OpenClaw Global` and preview the six reserved channels.
2. Add only governance/control channels such as `identity`, `writing-style`, `operating-principles`, `boundaries`, `inheritance`, and `skills` after approval.
3. Propose the topic and starter guidance from `docs/architecture/openclaw-global-channel-guides.md` before writing Discord-visible copy.
4. Require `approve write` before creating channels, updating topics, or posting starter guidance.
5. Do **not** treat these channels as Project Manager project categories or Project Manager `global-*` channels.
6. Record only fake/demo channel names in repo-safe evidence.

### Create Project Manager managed scaffolding

1. Create or verify the separate `Project Manager` global category.
2. Create or verify the managed global channels `global-context`, `global-skills`, `global-strategy`, `global-decisions`, and `global-config`.
3. Create or verify one project-specific category using the current per-project scaffolding contract.
4. Create or verify the project channels `context`, `skills`, `strategy`, `tasks`, `decisions`, and `qa`.
5. Use the semantic channel guide catalog for expected topics/descriptions and starter guidance.
6. Do **not** treat optional human review channels as required topology for the current Project Manager contract.

## Global context management guide

Use `docs/operations/openclaw-global-brand-context-refresh.md` as the source contract.

### Global control areas to manage

| Control area | What to verify |
|---|---|
| `identity` | stable positioning and project identity stay explicit |
| `writing-style` | voice/tone guidance stays reviewable and bounded |
| `operating-principles` | review/quality rules are readable and reusable |
| `boundaries` | safety/privacy/publishing limits stay explicit |
| `inheritance` | opt-in inheritance rules are explicit and never automatic |

### Global context review checklist

- [ ] Control input uses fake/demo notes only.
- [ ] Inheritance is explicit opt-in only.
- [ ] Global updates remain draft/proposal until `approve write`.
- [ ] Rejected or revised drafts remain runtime-local/audit-only.
- [ ] No raw transcripts, real IDs, or private names appear in evidence.

### Global context operator flow

1. Review one control area at a time.
2. Draft a reviewable summary before any persistence.
3. Propose inheritance to specific managed categories/projects only.
4. Preview the derived Context Pack / Skill Pack effect.
5. Require exact `approve write` before any durable write.
6. If rollback is needed, revert to the prior approved global draft and record a sanitized note only.

## Base channel guide by purpose

Use this table to explain what each channel type is for and what “working correctly” means.

| Channel type | Example | What to verify | Expected safe outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global governance | `identity` | control area is reviewable, explicit, and bounded | no automatic inheritance or hidden writes |
| Skills control | `skills` | effective skills and overrides are discussed explicitly | `discord-approval-gate` stays mandatory for write-like flows |
| Global strategy | `global-strategy` | shared strategy stays explicit and reviewable | remains proposal-first until approval |
| Global decisions | `global-decisions` | decisions and tradeoffs are recorded clearly | no implicit runtime writeback |
| Global skills | `global-skills` | effective skills and inheritance remain visible | `discord-approval-gate` stays mandatory for write-like flows |
| Project QA | `qa` | validation and release-gate work stays scoped to one project | no silent cross-project spillover |
| Managed project strategy | `strategy` | project strategy stays scoped to one managed project | planning only; no publishing or analytics claims |
| Managed project tasks | `tasks` | actionable work stays reviewable and bounded | no hidden execution or durable write |
| Approval response | managed channel write-like request | response state stays `proposal` or `approval-requested` | exact `approve write` phrase required |

## Managed routing and namespace expectations

### Managed channel expectation

For a Project Manager channel such as `Project - Linkedin` / `strategy`:

- runtime namespace must still be:

  ```text
  discord-project-manager/runtime/discord/<guild-id>/<channel-id>
  ```

- managed scope, field, and project should resolve from persisted semantic metadata/IDs, not from the display name alone;
- durable read candidates must stay scoped to the managed project and field being reviewed;
- durable writes remain approval-gated and proposal-first.

### Unmanaged channel expectation

For an extra unmanaged channel inside a managed category:

- report it as unmanaged/fallback-only;
- do not infer a project or field by name;
- do not read or write durable project namespaces;
- use status/repair preview flows before any create, update, or cleanup action.

### Skill/context layering expectation

When reviewing packs, expect these scopes when applicable:

- `runtime`
- `global`
- `category`
- `channel`
- `thread-session`
- `scoped-skill-context`

`discord-approval-gate` remains mandatory for write-like flows.

## Manual test matrix

Run only the tests that fit the currently approved boundary. If a test would require prompt execution, workspace writes, or durable writes before approval, stop and mark it blocked.

| Test ID | Area | Manual action | Expected result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DV-01` | Local runtime startup | Start the local/private runtime from the checklist | OpenClaw and Engram are healthy on loopback only | sanitized command output |
| `DV-02` | Global category setup | Create `OpenClaw Global` and control channels | governance/control surfaces are separate from Project Manager scaffolding | fake/demo topology note |
| `DV-03` | Project Manager global setup | Create or verify `Project Manager` and global channels | managed global channels exist with semantic guide topics/starter guidance | fake/demo topology note |
| `DV-04` | Project category setup | Create or verify one managed project category and channels | project channels exist with semantic guide topics/starter guidance | fake/demo topology note |
| `DV-05` | Global context review | Review one control area plus inheritance rule | inheritance is explicit opt-in only | sanitized checklist note |
| `DV-06` | Managed routing expectation | Using only status/dry-run preview, inspect one managed project channel | scope, field, and project resolve from semantic metadata/IDs | sanitized status outcome |
| `DV-07` | Unmanaged channel expectation | Using only status/dry-run preview, inspect an unmanaged channel inside a managed category if present | reported as unmanaged/fallback-only without durable reads/writes | sanitized status outcome |
| `DV-08` | Approval preview | Use a synthetic event or proven no-op preview for a write-like request | response state is `proposal` or `approval-requested`, never `approved-for-write` | sanitized approval excerpt |
| `DV-09` | Project/category context | Review one project-local context source | project/category context is explicit, scoped, and does not override global context silently | sanitized project-context checklist |
| `DV-10` | Skills and packs | Review effective skills for one managed project channel | `discord-approval-gate` is present and skill choices follow global -> project -> channel layering | sanitized skill-pack checklist |
| `DV-11` | Memory/context separation | Review runtime namespace and durable namespace targets for one planned action | runtime audit namespace stays separate from brand/strategy/ledger/network durable namespaces | sanitized namespace checklist |
| `DV-12` | Strategy contract | Review strategy output requirements in a strategy-oriented surface | confirmed facts, assumptions, and missing context stay separate | sanitized proposal checklist |
| `DV-13` | Ledger contract | Review ledger candidate shape and allowed states | only `draft`, `queued`, `published`, `archived` appear | sanitized ledger checklist |
| `DV-14` | LinkedIn planning contract | Review a LinkedIn weekly plan candidate | `planning_basis.missing_context` exists and planning stays review-only | sanitized candidate excerpt |
| `DV-15` | X/brief contract | Review brief or X planning candidate structure | network-separated planning stays bounded and approval-gated | sanitized candidate excerpt |
| `DV-16` | Evidence hygiene | Inspect captured notes/screenshots | no real IDs, secrets, transcripts, or raw logs are retained | sanitized evidence checklist |
| `DV-17` | Safe shutdown | Stop the local runtime | shutdown is clean and non-destructive | sanitized command output |

## Pass / fail matrix

| Area | Pass when | Fail when |
|---|---|---|
| Environment | local runtime starts, is healthy, and shuts down safely | runtime needs destructive cleanup or public surfaces |
| Topology | global/control and managed Project Manager channels are clearly separated | governance and project-management surfaces are blurred or guessed |
| Global context | inheritance is explicit and reviewable | inheritance is assumed or automatic |
| Category context | category-local context is explicit, scoped, and subordinate to approved inheritance | category context silently overrides global rules or leaks across routes |
| Skills and packs | effective skills are visible and `discord-approval-gate` stays mandatory | write-like flows omit the approval gate or hide skill overrides |
| Memory/context | runtime audit namespaces and durable target namespaces stay separate | runtime notes become durable memory or workspace files without approval |
| Managed routing | scope, field, and project resolution are reviewable through status/dry-run preview | routing proof requires prompt execution, display-name guessing, or writes |
| Approval | `approve write` stays explicit and no-op boundaries are visible | approval is bypassed or silent writes appear |
| Workflow contracts | strategy, ledger, LinkedIn, X, and briefs stay bounded and fake-first | live execution, publishing, or durable writes are implied |
| Evidence | only sanitized notes are kept | real IDs, secrets, transcripts, or private payloads appear |

## Sanitized evidence checklist

- [ ] Use placeholders such as `<guild-id>` and `<channel-id>`.
- [ ] Keep real guild/channel IDs outside the repo.
- [ ] Do not commit credentials, tokens, or `.env` values.
- [ ] Do not commit Discord exports, full screenshots with secrets, or transcripts.
- [ ] Keep route outcomes, approval states, and namespace notes short and review-safe.
- [ ] Record whether a test was `pass`, `blocked`, or `not run`.

## Stop rules / abort conditions

Stop immediately if any of these appear:

- production credentials are required;
- the environment points at a public guild/channel;
- a managed status/routing check requires prompt execution or workspace writes;
- a write-like request causes durable writes before explicit approval;
- plugin setup is not reversible or is unclear;
- evidence would require raw transcripts, raw logs, secrets, or private payloads;
- the flow implies publishing, scheduling, Buffer activity, live analytics, or GitHub mutations.

## Known gaps / not yet proven

These remain **not yet proven** even after following this guide:

- live Discord plugin/runtime behavior;
- approval enforcement safety under real Discord traffic;
- durable write safety from Discord-originated requests;
- public Discord readiness;
- production credentials or production hosting readiness;
- live analytics, publishing, scheduling, or Buffer behavior.

Treat this guide as operator preparation for a **future gated rehearsal**, not as proof that the Discord runtime is already ready.

## Next step

Continue #132 with managed Project Manager global/project scaffolding only. Keep execution blocked until the private environment, explicit approval, status/repair preview path, and approval-gate behavior are all available.
